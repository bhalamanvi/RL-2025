This task analyzed two classic control challenges from the Gymnasium library: MountainCar-v0 and Acrobot-v1. Both environments are essential for understanding how reinforcement learning agents handle dynamic systems.

In MountainCar-v0, a weak car must learn to swing back and forth to build enough momentum to reach the target on the right hill. It uses a 2D space (position/velocity) and three actions (left, right, or nothing), with rewards only given when the goal is achieved.

In Acrobot-v1, the agent must swing a two-link pendulum upward to a vertical target by applying torque only to the second joint. This requires precise, coordinated action planning within a 6D observation space (angles and angular velocities).

These environments demonstrate core concepts like sparse rewards and the importance of action planning, providing insight into how observation and action complexity influence agent design.
